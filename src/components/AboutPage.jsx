        <p>
          <strong>The Plant Based Hub</strong> was born out of a passion for <strong>healthy eating</strong>,{" "}

          living easier and more enjoyable. With diverse backgrounds in nutrition, culinary arts, and technology, our
          team came together to create a resource that could transform the way people approach plant-based diets.
